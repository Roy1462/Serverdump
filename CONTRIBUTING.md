We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Reporting a bug Discussing the current state of the code Submitting a fix Proposing new features Becoming a maintainer

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

Fork the repository and create your branch from master. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. Make sure your code lints. Issue that pull request!

GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTING

Maintain two types of files, separate logic with UI components Put all the Constants under Constant.js

Use a Consistent Coding Style I'm again borrowing these from Facebook's Guidelines

2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs You can try running npm run lint for style unification
